# QuadraticCalc
Quadratic factoring and solving program (Java).

## Command Line
In src/com/megaamoonguss/quadraticcalccmd a more command line friendly version of QuadraticCalc can be found. Instead of promting you for a, b, and c directly, they are entered as command line arguments.
### Example: Factoring x^2 + 2x + 3
Syntax for running the program always differs depending on your working directory, whether or not you compiled to a JAR file, whether or not you specified the main class file, and what you named the JAR. Assuming you did all those things, named the file quadcalc.jar, and are working in the same directory that the JAR is located in, enter:

`java -jar quadcalc.jar 1 2 3`

Note: This probably has a ton of bugs in it, and it has been remade a bunch of time. I would suggest looking at QuadraticCalc-c or GMath-py for better (and much prettier) quadratic factoring.
